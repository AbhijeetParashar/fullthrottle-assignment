This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Problem Statement
Design and implement a user interface that allows a user to view a list of hardcoded
users from a mock API server. On clicking on any user, a modal should open which displays
all the time ranges during which they were active on that day, with an option to view all the
periods of activity for different days using a calendar.

## Improvised Solution
The users list will be available in one side of the screen, on tap of any user, the user details will be shown in a panel which will have all the activetime periods.
Now user can click on the "Calender" Icon to Open a modal and check the day.
